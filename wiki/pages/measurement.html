  <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
  <p>Within a single-cell bacterial factory, exogenous genes are expressed to modify metabolites. <strong>Co-expression</strong> is often achieved by <strong>co-transforming</strong> two or more plasmids, each carrying the gene of one subunit and a different selection marker, into the heterologous expression host. However, the number of plasmids used is not infinite, and simultaneously maintaining more than four plasmids is very challenging.</p>
<p>The <strong>uneven copy numbers</strong> of each plasmid make protein expression and metabolite production unpredictable. Another approach is to <strong>assemble multiple genes into one plasmid</strong> where genes are transcribed from multiple promoters (1) or a single promoter to produce long lines of cis mRNA (2).</p>
<p>Polycistronic expression suffers from a major problem: translations of cistrons are severely unbalanced. The order of cistrons in the polycistronic mRNA has an unpredictable consequence on the levels of protein expression (3). <strong>Progressively lower expression was reported with more downstream cistron in the mRNA</strong> (4).</p>
<p>The must step to validate our/your engineering design works is not until <strong>the target product is present and detected</strong>. We integrated a whole set of measurement approaches to validate <a href="/fudan/parts">our parts</a>, which can be applied to other occasions as well.</p>

<p>Before we verify protein expression we need to confirm whether <strong>the target gene has been successfully transformed into the plasmids</strong>.</p>

<p style="font-size:0.8rem;color:grey"><strong>Figure 1.</strong> Agarose gel electrophoresis of PCR products, amplified from a bacterial colony.</p>
<p>The first lane was loaded with a D2000 DNA ladder whose sizes were marked on the image. We chose Taq DNA polymerase for its low cost and high reliability, and we designed forward and reverse primers for each carotene synthesis enzyme (crt for short). The PCR reaction was composed of 2 μL 10x Taq polymerase buffer, 16 μL H2O, 0.5 μL Taq polymerase, 0.5 μL dNTP (10 mM each), 0.5 μL forward primer (10 mM), 0.5 μL reverse primer (10 mM), and 1 colony picked from the plate. Using the same forward primer, and different reverse primers, we were able to detect the composition of various crt genes. After PCR, the correct bacterial clones were sent for Sanger sequencing, which take 24-48 hours. While waiting, we start preparing the following experiments. Once the sequencing confirmed, we execute the next.</p>

<p style="font-size:0.8rem;color:grey"><strong>Figure 2.</strong> SDS-PAGE of whole cell lysate of bacterial cultures.</p>
<p>Protein expression was induced in parallel cultures by IPTG. Bacterial cultures were monitored by OD600, and 5x10^7 cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysis in 1x SDS sample buffer. An equal amount (10 μL, 2x10^6 cells) of whole cell lysate was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (4~20% gradient gel, Tanon brand). Red arrows point to crtI protein. Green arrows point to crtY protein. Black arrows point to crtB protein. Yellow arrows point to crtE protein.</p>

<p style="font-size:0.8rem;color:grey"><strong>Figure 3.</strong> We failed to see IPTG induced expression of the membrane protein BCMO on the protein gel, so we turned to microscopy by tagging fluorescent protein downstream the target protein, which is included <a href="#fluorescence-microscopy-to-confirm-the-successful-expression-of-membrane-proteins">on this page</a>.</p>

<h3 id="color-changes-to-verify-β-carotene-production">Color changes to verify β-carotene production</h3>
<p>As our intermediate product is the yellow β-carotene, we can confirm its presence simply by observing the color change in the bacterial pellet, sometime even the liquid bacterial culture. It served as the visual assay to tell whether the four crt enzymes cooperated effectively under the same or different types of RBS.</p>
<p>No color change in the bacterial pellet along with the unequal protein expression induced by IPTG pushed us to adjust the strength of RBS in front of each enzyme. By enhancing RBS or weakening it, we successfully obtained the yellow products, as shown in <a href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K4162117" target="_blank">BBa_K4162117</a> and <a href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K4162118" target="_blank">BBa_K4162118</a>.</p>

<h3 id="fluorescence-microscopy-to-confirm-the-successful-expression-of-membrane-proteins">Fluorescence microscopy to confirm the successful expression of membrane proteins</h3>
<p>Failure in observing the expression of membrane protein BCMO from SDS-PAGE pushed us to reflect and try to figure out which step went wrong. We could not any band on the protein gel after induction by IPTG in BL21(DE3) strain, and we confirmed that we are using the same design as reported (5). This situation set us thinking maybe it should be the assay’s fault. After consulting Prof. Motoyuki Hattori, who has extensive knowledge in expressing, purifying membrane protein, we knew that SDS-PAGE with CBB staining is not suitable for membrane protein expression detection, which is always below the detection. So, we changed to this fluorescence microscopy assay.</p>

<h3 id="hplc-for-detection-of-retinoids">HPLC for detection of retinoids</h3>
<p>After we observed the color change of the system, for quantitative detection and validation with chemical standards, we applied HPLC to detect β-carotene and retinoids.</p>

<p style="font-size:0.8rem;color:grey"><strong>Figure 6.</strong> Acetone extracted samples were subjected to HPLC (C18 column)as described previously (5), except we are using methanol:water = 96:4 as the moving phase.

<h3 id="verify-that-adjusting-rbs-intensity-promotes-metabolism">Verify that adjusting RBS intensity promotes metabolism</h3>
<p>In our project, we used ribozyme to build our crtEBIY biobrick. With the help of self-cleaving ribozyme, self-interaction of the polycistron can be nullified and the translation of each cistron can be basically dependent on the strength of its RBS.</p>
<p>When the RBS strength of the four enzymes in the linear reaction was consistent, the results of the protein gel map showed that the expression of upstream proteins was higher than that of downstream proteins after IPTG induction, which was not in line with our expectation of  the equal consistent  level of the four enzymes. Moreover, the system was not yellowing, indicating that we do not have the ideal product β-carotene.</p>
<p><strong>When we weakened the RBS strength of the upstream protein and increased the RBS strength of the downstream protein</strong>, the protein map showed similar expression levels of the four enzymes, and the solution turned yellow, indicating that we had obtained β-carotene.</p>
<p>By <strong>combining protein mapping</strong> (Figure7.proof one) with <strong>the observation of system color changes</strong> (Figure4.proof two), we could verify the conclusion that <em><strong>adjusting the RBS strength of individual mono-cistrons in the presence of ribozyme in polycistronic plasmids could promote linear reactions and bacterial metabolism</strong></em>.</p>

<p style="font-size:0.8rem;color:grey"><strong>Figure7.</strong> Proof one of efficiency of ribozyme.</p>
<h3 id="membrane-protein-detection">Membrane protein detection</h3>
<p>Initially we chose to detect the expression level of the membrane protein BCMO in DH5α  and Hi-control BL21(DE3) by SDS-PAGE with CBB staining. However, we came to realize that it is not suitable for membrane protein expression detection, attributed to the degradation of membrane proteins as they are separated from the membrane.</p>
<p>To detect the expression of membrane proteins without affecting their activity, we tagged a segment of fluorescent protein behind the membrane proteins sequence. In this way, <strong>it is not necessary to lyse the bacteria and destroy the protein structure, and the conclusion that BCMO is successfully expressed can be obtained by observing the fluorescent substances under the microscope.</strong></p>

    <h2 id="conclusion">Summary</h2>
<p>We integrated a series of detection methods to <strong>solve the problem that the upstream reaction failure of polycistronic plasmids in the multi-plasmid co-transformation system may lead to the failure of the downstream reaction</strong>, so that the final product can not be obtained. We divided the reaction into several steps, through <strong>stage verification</strong>, step by step <strong>error correction and optimization</strong>, so as to promote the reaction step by step,  to ensure the work efficiency of the system and get the final product. On the basis of the detection results, the reaction was optimized  by introducing <strong>ribozyme</strong>, <strong>adjusting RBS strength</strong> and other parameters, and introducing <strong>TEARS</strong>, an enzyme enrichment tool, to <strong>increase the yield for further commercial use</strong> .</p>
