<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The research approach of synthetic biology is more like an engineering method than a traditional biological method. In practice, the designs of synthetic biology are focused on biological functions. That is to say that synthetic biology follows the principle of from bottom to top, specifically from parts to devices and finally to system. As is explained above, parts, as the foundation, play an important role.</p>
<p>The idea of parts standardization was put forward by Drew Endy in 2005. When creating or modifying corresponding biological components, the standardization of parts must carry it out. For the standardized settings of parts, the parts created by one person can be reused by all researchers through standardized settings. And that’s why all teams must submit their parts in the iGem competition.</p>
<p>Since a great database of standardized parts was provided by the iGEM community, there’s no reason not to make full use of the parts database. A problem was encountered when first collecting information and resources for our parts design this year. Although the parts database is provided, we cannot quickly identify which part is most related to our project from the parts registration page because there is no powerful search tool for us yet.</p>
<p>Therefore, we decided to develop PartHub for the iGEM competition, as an assistant tool for the parts database. We hope that PartHub can help future teams and researchers design their parts.</p>

</table><p>All searches here are case-insensitive and support partial match retrieval. In addition, PartHub supports boolean search with multiple search terms (The format of the boolean search with multiple search terms should be xxx AND xxx or xxx OR xxx).</p>
<p>What’s more, PartHub supports fuzzy search. For example, you want to search for <em>beta AND carotene</em> but you accidentally type in <em>bata AND carotene</em>, PartHub will automatically do the fuzzy search for you and the result will be:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/4162/wiki/software/fuzzysearch.png" alt="fuzzysearch.png (2880×1800) (igem.wiki)"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>View sorted searching results (you can choose certain sorting order). PartHub provides several ways to sort the results, like Most cited, Best match, etc. In this way, users can organize the result in order to their needs. Sorting by Recommended is a weighted sort that considers various aspects of suitability and can be used in situations where users are unsure which sort is more appropriate for their needs.</p>

<h3 id="web-crawler">Web Crawler</h3>
<p>To get data of parts from Registry of Standard Biological Parts, the Web Crawler based on <a href="https://www.selenium.dev/">selenium</a> framework was developed. The information of the parts in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts is standardized, hence the information can be obtained by crawling through the elements of the fixed XPath. We ended up deploying the Web Crawler on a Windows-based server (Linux is also supported). A high-performance computer is recommended due to the vast number of pages on Registry of Standard Biological Parts(It is not suggested to use personal computer to run the web crawler), and it’s especially recommended for HPC platforms. The following is our computer configuration:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>CPUs</th>
<th>Dual Intel® Xeon E5-2680v2(10core, 20thread, 2.80 GHz to 3.60 GHz)</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>

<td>Memory</td>
<td>64GB, DDR3, 1600MHz</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hard Drive</td>
<td>500GB, NVMe, SSD</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>GPU</td>
<td>NVIDIA® GeForce GTX1050 Ti</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table><p>Additionally, since the Web Crawler supports inputting a range of years to crawl data, it just needs to crawl the most recent year’s data for merging with each year’s update to achieve continuous updates of the parts stored in PartHub.</p>
<p>Finally, after merging each year’s collection and data cleaning, we will save the collected data to a .csv file, which will include information such as the part number and name, content, citation, etc.</p>
<h3 id="deployment-of-parthub">Deployment of PartHub</h3>
<p>The acquired .csv file will be loaded to establish nodes for each part, construct a relationship network of parts with citations and twin parts relationships, creating a <a href="https://neo4j.com/">Neo4j</a> database. For querying Neo4j databases afterwards, the <a href="https://neo4j.com/developer/cypher/?ref=cypher-web-page">Cypher</a> language, which is an efficient database query language, is required. To facilitate data transmission between the back-end and the database, <a href="https://py2neo.org/2021.1/#">py2neo</a> is applied to gain database access to the back-end.</p>
<p>PartHub’s back-end is based on python, and a public PartHub is currently working on the server of AWS (Amazon Web Services) with the configuration of t3.xlarge. Private deployment of PartHub or public deployment of mirrored PartHub is warmly welcomed.</p>
<h3 id="search-logic">Search logic</h3>
<p>There are options for what to search, which based on the different features in Registry of Standard Biological Parts. PartHub provides search optimizations such as support for complementary sequence search, fuzzy search, and search result sorting.PartHub provides search optimizations such as support for complementary sequence search, fuzzy search, boolean search with multiple search terms so that users can combine users search terms with and or relations. For the search results, each search result represents a part, and the basic information is neatly listed, click on the title to draw the relationship network tree related to this part as the center, which can find a large number of connections between parts that can not be found in the iGEM built-in search engine.</p>
<p>Also, PartHub provides several ways to sort the results, like Most cited, Best match, etc. In this way, users can organize the result in order to their needs. Sorting by Recommended is a weighted sort that considers various aspects of suitability and can be used in situations where users are unsure which sort is more appropriate for their needs.</p>
<h3 id="visualization-of-relationship-between-parts">Visualization of relationship between parts</h3>
<p>Under the structure of Neo4j, we manage to visualize the relationship between parts. Each node stands for a specific iGEM part in the database, while the line between nodes represents the cite and cited relationship or twin parts relationship. The number of citations and publication time of part are directly presented by the size and color of the nodes. The canvas outputs are interactive, allowing the user to zoom, drag nodes, and click nodes, etc. In addition, the necessary information is presented in a table on the side, and if the part is of interest to the user, he can directly access its page in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts or directly obtain its sequence (if it exists).</p>
<h3 id="cross-platform-compatibility">Cross-platform compatibility</h3>
<p>In order to ensure a robust cross-platform approach for PartHub, we chose to develop a web-based user interaction module. It is also important to use universal features and interfaces when developing web applications in order to achieve good cross-platform performance. PartHub can be used on a PC (either Windows, Linux or macOS), iPad, iPhone or Android phone. The following browsers have been tested to work (does not mean that the browsers not listed do not work):</p>
