    <h2>Tips</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>This wiki will be your team's first interaction with the rest of the world, so here are a few tips to help you get started:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>State your accomplishments! Tell people what you have achieved from the start.</li>
      <li>Be clear about what you are doing and how you plan to do this.</li>
      <li>You have a global audience! Consider the different backgrounds that your users come from.</li>
      <li>Make sure information is easy to find; nothing should be more than 3 clicks away.</li>
      <li>Avoid using very small fonts and low contrast colors; information should be easy to read.</li>
      <li>Start documenting your project as early as possible; don't leave anything to the last minute before the Wiki Freeze. For a complete list of deadlines visit the iGEM 2022 calendar</li>
      <li>Have lots of fun!</li>
